# Geometry-Shape-Recognition
> “Geometry shape detector” which is identifying shape such as circle, rectangle, triangle, straight line and so on. Actually this project working on supervised data. First of all, we are import images which are some geometric shape on many type of drawn and every same shape classifies same class. Then convert Image to binary image then convert 1D matrix by using image processing mechanism.

* Sample Data:

* Brief description of the steps:
1. First of all, we are import images which are some geometric shape on many type of drawn and every same shape classifies same class.

2. Then convert Image to Gray scale image.

3. Convert image to matrix using image processing mechanism.

4. Convert matrix to 1D array.

5. Training all data and testing data for calculating accuracy.

6. User input test image or draw in paint for test image

7. Then system run algorithms (KNN, Logistic Regression, perceptron. etc.) and predict result.
