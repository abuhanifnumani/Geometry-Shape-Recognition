# Geometry-Shape-Recognition
> “Geometry shape detector” which is identifying shape such as circle, rectangle, triangle, straight line and so on. Actually this project working on supervised data.<br>
> First of all, we are import images which are some geometric shape on many type of drawn and every same shape classifies same class. Then convert Image to binary image then convert 1D matrix by using image processing mechanism.
